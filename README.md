# RWR-vector-embedded-edges

Configurable & fast online recommendation system for in-memory tabular data that can be represented as a bipartite graph. We use simulatity of embedded vectors to combind both the structural similarities of the network as well as the similarities between edge vectors.

Recsys network algorithm designed to return a configurable node neighborhood for nodes of a given type on a bipartite graph.
